# Gradle Enterprise build configuration samples

<img src="http://bit.ly/2JSSCT0" align="right" width="280" />

This repository contains tools and code samples that demonstrate how to optimize and customize your Gradle Enterprise build configuration using Gradle or Maven.

The samples aim to demonstrate optimizations, customizations, API usages, as well as patterns for reusing Gradle Enterprise build configuration across multiple projects. While we do invest in keeping the code current and working, none of the code in this repository has gone through the same rigorous, continuous, and automated testing as our commercial components of Gradle Enterprise.

## Samples

The samples can be roughly grouped into the following categories:
 
 - Tools and snippets to improve and optimize build performance
 - Data capturing scripts that demonstrate how to gather specific data
 - Bundles for build configuration and data capturing that can be applied on multiple projects

Every sample contains some explanatory information on its purpose and how to make use of it.
