      summary: Create a new access token
      description: Create a new short-lived access token, optionally limited to the provided permissions and projects. Users do not need any specific Develocity permission to do this. If an access key is used to authenticate this request, the created token will be limited to the user's permissions and projects. If an access token is used to authenticate this request, the created token will be limited to the authenticating token's permissions and projects and not live longer than the authenticating token's remaining lifetime. Query parameters can be used to further restrict the permissions of the access token. A 403 response will be sent if one of the projects or permissions present in the query parameters is not assigned to this user. A 403 will also be sent if an access token is used to authenticate the request and the requested expiration date is after the authenticating access token's expiration.

      Returns a list of builds with common attributes.
      The returned list is capped by the `maxBuilds` and `maxWaitSecs` query parameters.
      This endpoint supports pagination by using the `fromBuild` or `sinceBuild` query parameters, and the last returned build from a previous call to one of these endpoints.

                A unix-epoch-time in milliseconds allowing to retrieve builds for which Develocity completed receiving and processing the build after this instant when used in conjunction with `reverse=false`, or before this instant when used in conjunction with `reverse=true`.
                Therefore, a value of `0` will process all builds.
                If not provided, the time in milliseconds when the request is received by the Develocity instance will be used.
                This parameter has no effect if `fromBuild` is used.
            fromBuild:
              type: string
              nullable: true
              description: |
                A Build Scan ID allowing to retrieve builds for which Develocity completed receiving and processing after the given Build Scan ID (excluding it) when used in conjunction with `reverse=false`, or before the given Build Scan ID (excluding it) when used in conjunction with `reverse=true`.
                This parameter has precedence over any value set for the `since`, `sinceBuild`, `fromInstant` parameters.
                A valid Build Scan ID must be provided, that is, a Build Scan ID that exists in the Develocity instance.
                A Build Scan ID for a deleted build is valid.

              type: boolean
              nullable: true
              description: |
                A boolean indicating the time direction of the query.
                A value of `true` indicates a backward query, and returned builds will be sorted from most to least recent.
                A value of `false` indicates a forward query, and returned builds will be sorted from least to most recent.
                This parameter has no effect if any of `since`, `sinceBuild` are used.
                If not provided, the default value is `false`.

              nullable: true
              description: |
                The maximum number of builds returned by the query.
                The query returns when that number is reached or when `maxWaitSecs` is reached.
                If not provided, the default value is `100`.
            maxWaitSecs:
              type: integer

              maximum: 20
              nullable: true
              description: |
                The maximum number of seconds to wait for builds before returning.
                If this time is reached before `maxBuilds` is reached, the query returns with the already processed builds.
                Note that this time is respected with best effort.
                A query will return soon after this time has passed but there is no guarantee that it exactly returns before this time has passed.
                This parameter has no effect if `reverse=true` is specified, because new builds cannot become available in the past.
                If not provided, the default value is `3`.

                This parameter can only be used with `reverse=false`.
                Therefore, a value of `0` will process all builds.

              * `cache-if_condition_not_matched` - Caching is disabled for the task via `org.gradle.api.tasks.TaskOutputs#cacheIf`
              * `disabled_to_ensure_correctness` - The task failed validation. Available since Gradle 7.0
              * `do-not-cache-if_condition_matched` - Caching is disabled for the task via `org.gradle.api.tasks.TaskOutputs#doNotCacheIf`
              * `multiple_outputs_declared` - The task declares multiple outputs
              * `no_outputs_declared` - The task has no outputs declared
              * `non_cacheable_inputs` - One of the task inputs is not cacheable, either because some type used as an input to the task is loaded via a custom classloader, or a Java lambda is used as an input. Available since Gradle 5.0 and before Gradle 7.5
              * `non_cacheable_task_action` - One of the task actions is not cacheable, either because it is loaded via a custom classloader, or a Java lambda is used to implement it. Available since Gradle 5.0 and before Gradle 7.5
              * `non_cacheable_task_implementation` - The task implementation is not cacheable, either because it is loaded via a custom classloader, or a Java lambda is used to implement it. Available since Gradle 5.0 and before Gradle 7.5
              * `non_cacheable_tree_output` - The task has a `org.gradle.api.file.FileTree` or a `org.gradle.api.internal.file.collections.DirectoryFileTree` as an output. Available since Gradle 5.0
              * `overlapping_outputs` - The tasks outputs overlaps with another task. As Gradle cannot safely determine which task each output file belongs to, it disables caching            
              * `task_has_no_actions` - The task does not declare any actions
              * `task_output_caching_not_enabled` - Caching is not enabled for the task
              * `unknown` - Reason for disabled caching is not known
