<!-- Common gradle-enterprise.xml configuration for Maven shared between CI agents and developers building locally.

     The build cache credentials required for CI builds to write to the remote build cache are read from environment variables.
     Possibly, the credentials are configured in Jenkins via Credentials plugin (https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials/) and
     Credentials Binding plugin (https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials-binding/), or the credentials are injected using the
     vendor-specific mechanism of the CI server running the build.

     Note: In the XML configuration below, you need to adjust

             - the server url of your Gradle Enterprise server
             - the name of the environment variable that reveals the build is running in a CI environment
             - the names of the environment variables holding the build cache credentials

           to the specifics of your CI server settings. -->
