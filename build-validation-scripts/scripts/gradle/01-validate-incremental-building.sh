In this experiment, you will validate how well a given project leverages
Gradle’s incremental build functionality. A build is considered fully
incremental if it can be invoked twice in a row with build caching disabled and,
during the second invocation, all tasks avoid performing any work because:

  * The tasks' inputs have not changed since their last invocation and
  * The tasks' outputs are still present

The experiment will reveal tasks with volatile inputs, for example tasks that
contain a timestamp in one of their inputs. It will also reveal tasks that produce
non-deterministic outputs consumed by tasks downstream that participate in
incremental building, for example tasks generating code with non-deterministic
method ordering or tasks producing artifacts that include timestamps.

The experiment will assist you to first identify those tasks that do not
participate in Gradle’s incremental build functionality, to then make an
informed decision which of those tasks are worth improving to make your build
faster, to then investigate why they do not participate in incremental building,
and to finally fix them once you understand the root cause.

The experiment can be run on any developer’s machine. It logically consists of
the following steps:

  1. Disable build caching completely
  2. Run the build with a typical task invocation including the 'clean' task
  3. Run the build with the same task invocation but without the 'clean' task
  4. Determine which tasks are still executed in the second run and why
  5. Assess which of the executed tasks are worth improving
  6. Fix identified tasks

The script you have invoked automates the execution of step 1, step 2, and step 3
without modifying the project. Build scans support your investigation in step 4
and step 5.

After improving the build to make it more incremental, you can push your changes
and run the experiment again. This creates a cycle of run → measure → improve →
run.

Now that the project has been checked out, the first build can be run with the
given Gradle tasks. The build will be invoked with the 'clean' task included
and build caching disabled.

${USER_ACTION_COLOR}Press <Enter> to run the first build of the experiment.${RESTORE}

Now that the first build has finished successfully, the second build can be run
with the same Gradle tasks. This time, the build will be invoked without the
'clean' task included and build caching still disabled.

Now that the second build has finished successfully, you are ready to measure in
Gradle Enterprise how well your build leverages Gradle’s local build cache for
the invoked set of Gradle tasks.

The 'Summary' section below captures the configuration of the experiment and the
two build scans that were published as part of running the experiment. The build
scan of the second build is particularly interesting since this is where you can
inspect what tasks were not leveraging Gradle’s incremental build functionality.

The 'Investigation Quick Links' section below allows quick navigation to the
most relevant views in build scans to investigate what tasks were uptodate and
what tasks executed in the second build, which of those tasks had the biggest
impact on build performance, and what caused those tasks to not be uptodate.

The 'Command Line Invocation' section below demonstrates how you can rerun the
experiment with the same configuration and in non-interactive mode.

$(print_summary)

$(print_command_to_repeat_experiment)

Once you have addressed the issues surfaced in build scans and pushed the
changes to your Git repository, you can rerun the experiment and start over the
cycle of run → measure → improve → run.
