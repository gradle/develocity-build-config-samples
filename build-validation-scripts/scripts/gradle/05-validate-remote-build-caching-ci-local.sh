In this experiment, you will validate how well a given project leverages
Gradle's remote build caching functionality when running the build from
a CI agent and then on a local machine. A build is considered fully cacheable
if it can be invoked twice in a row with build caching enabled and, during the
second invocation, all cacheable tasks avoid performing any work because:

  * The cacheable tasks' inputs have not changed since their last invocation and
  * The cacheable tasks' outputs are present in the remote build cache and
  * No cacheable tasks were excluded from build caching to ensure correctness

The experiment will reveal tasks with volatile inputs, for example tasks that
contain a timestamp in one of their inputs. It will also reveal tasks that
produce non-deterministic outputs consumed by cacheable tasks downstream, for
example tasks generating code with non-deterministic method ordering or tasks
producing artifacts that include timestamps. It will also reveal tasks that
contain an absolute file path in one of their inputs.

The experiment will assist you to first identify those tasks whose outputs are
not taken from the remote build cache due to changed inputs or to ensure
correctness of the build, to then make an informed decision which of those tasks
are worth improving to make your build faster, to then investigate why they are
not taken from the remote build cache, and to finally fix them once you
understand the root cause.

The first part of the experiment runs in your CI environment and the second
part of the experiment runs on any developer's machine. It logically consists of
the following steps:

  1. Enable only remote build caching and use an empty remote build cache
  2. On a given CI agent, run a typical CI configuration from a fresh checkout
  3. On a developer machine, run the build with the same task invocation including the ‘clean’ task with the same commit id
  4. Determine which cacheable tasks are still executed in the second run and why
  5. Assess which of the executed, cacheable tasks are worth improving
  6. Fix identified tasks

The script you have invoked does not automate the execution of step 1 and step 2.
You will need to complete these steps manually. The script automates the
execution of step 3 without modifying the project. Build scans support your
investigation in step 4 and step 5.

After improving the build to make it better leverage the remote build cache, you
can push your changes and run the experiment again. This creates a cycle of run
→ measure → improve → run.

${HEADER_COLOR}Preparation I. - Configure build with Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin${RESTORE}

To get the most out of this experiment and also when building with Gradle
Enterprise during daily development, it is advisable that you apply the Common
Custom User Data Gradle plugin to your build, if not already the case. Gradle
provides the Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin as a free, open-source add-on.

https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradle.common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin

An extract of a typical build configuration is described below.

settings.gradle:
plugins {
    id 'com.gradle.enterprise' version '<latest version>'
    id 'com.gradle.common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin' version '<latest version>'
}

Your updated build configuration should be pushed before proceeding.

${HEADER_COLOR}Preparation II. - Configure build for remote build caching${RESTORE}

You must first configure your build for remote build caching. An extract of a
typical build configuration is described below.

gradle.properties:
org.gradle.caching=true

settings.gradle:
def isCi = System.getenv('BUILD_URL') != null   // adjust to an env var that is always present in your CI environment
buildCache {
  local { enabled = false }                     // must be false for this experiment
  remote(HttpBuildCache) {
    url = 'https://ge.example.com/cache/exp5/'  // adjust to your GE hostname, and note the trailing slash
    allowUntrustedServer = true                 // set to false if a trusted certificate is configured for the GE server
    credentials { creds ->
      // inject credentials with read-write access to the remote build cache via env vars set in your CI environment
      creds.username = System.getenv('GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_CACHE_USERNAME')
      creds.password = System.getenv('GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_CACHE_PASSWORD')
    }
    enabled = true                              // must be true for this experiment
    push = isCI                                 // must be true when the build runs in CI
}}

Your updated build configuration needs to be pushed to a separate branch that
is only used for running the experiments.

${HEADER_COLOR}Preparation III. - Purge remote build cache${RESTORE}

It is important to use an empty remote build cache and to avoid that other
builds write to the same remote build cache while this experiment is running.
Ensuring that these preconditions are met will maximize the reproducibility
and reliability of the experiment. Two different ways to meet these conditions
are described below.

a) If none of your builds are yet writing to the remote build cache besides
the builds of this experiment, purge the remote build cache that your build
is configured to connect to. You can purge the remote build cache by navigating
in the browser to the 'Build Cache' admin section from the user menu of your
Gradle Enterprise UI, selecting the build cache node the build is pointing to,
and then clicking the 'Purge cache' button.

b) If you are not in a position to purge the remote build cache, you can connect
to a unique shard of the remote build cache each time you run this experiment.
A shard is accessed via an identifier that is appended to the path of the remote
build cache URL, for example https://ge.example.com/cache/exp5-2021-Dec31-take1/
which encodes the experiment type, the current date, and a counter that needs
to be increased every time the experiment is rerun. Using such an encoding
schema ensures that for each run of the experiment an empty remote build cache
will be used. You need to push the changes to the path of the remote build cache
URL every time before you run the experiment.

If you choose option b) and do not want to interfere with an already existing
build caching configuration in your build and you are using the Common Custom
User Data Gradle plugin, you can override the local and remote build cache
configuration via system properties or environment variables right when
triggering the build on CI. Details on how to provide the overrides are
available from the documentation of the plugin.

https://github.com/gradle/gradle-enterprise-build-config-samples/blob/master/common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin/README.md#configuration-overrides

${HEADER_COLOR}Run first build on CI agent${RESTORE}

You can now trigger the first build on one of your CI agents. The invoked CI
configuration should be a configuration that is typically triggered when
building the project as part of your pipeline during daily development.

Make sure the CI configuration uses the proper branch and performs a fresh
checkout to avoid any build artifacts lingering around from a previous build
that could influence the experiment.

Once the build completes, make a note of the commit id that was used, and enter
the URL of the build scan produced by the build.

${HEADER_COLOR}Fetch build scan data${RESTORE}

Now that the build on CI has finished successfully, some of the build scan
data will be fetched from the provided build scan to assist you in your
investigation.

The build scan data will be fetched via the Gradle Enterprise Export API. It is
not strictly necessary that you have permission to call the Export API while
doing this experiment, but the summary provided at the end of the experiment
will be more comprehensive if the build scan data is accessible. You can check
your granted permissions by navigating in the browser to the 'My Settings'
section from the user menu of your Gradle Enterprise UI. Your Gradle Enterprise
access key must be specified in the ~/.gradle/enterprise/keys.properties file.

https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/#via_file

Some of the fetched build scan data is expected to be present as custom values.
By default, this experiment assumes that these custom values have been created
by the Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin. If you are not using that plugin
but your build still captures the same data under different custom value names,
you can provide a mapping file so that the required data can be extracted from
your build scans. An example mapping file named 'mapping.example' can be found
at the same location as the script.

Now that the first build has finished successfully on CI and the build scan
data has been fetched or at least attempted to be fetched, the second build
can be run locally with the same commit id, the same Gradle tasks, and the
same remote build cache as was used by the first build.

The local build will run after a fresh checkout of the given project stored in
Git. The fresh checkout ensures reproducibility of the experiment across machines
and users since no local changes and commits will be accidentally included in the
validation process.

Make sure the local build uses the proper branch and commit id.

The ‘Summary’ section below captures the configuration of the experiment and the
two build scans that were published as part of running the experiment.  The
build scan of the second build is particularly interesting since this is where
you can inspect what tasks were not leveraging Gradle’s remote build cache.

The ‘Investigation Quick Links’ section below allows quick navigation to the
most relevant views in build scans to investigate what task outputs were fetched
from the remote cache and what tasks executed in the second build with cache
misses, which of those tasks had the biggest impact on build performance, and
what caused the cache misses.

The ‘Command Line Invocation’ section below demonstrates how you can rerun the
experiment with the same configuration and in non-interactive mode.
