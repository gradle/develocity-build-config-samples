In this experiment, you will validate how well a given project leverages
Gradle’s local build caching functionality when running the build in the same
location. A build is considered fully cacheable if it can be invoked twice in a
row with build caching enabled and, during the second invocation, all cacheable
tasks avoid performing any work because:

  * The cacheable tasks’ inputs have not changed since their last invocation and
  * The cacheable tasks’ outputs are present in the local build cache and
  * No cacheable tasks were excluded from build caching to ensure correctness

The experiment will reveal tasks with volatile inputs, for example tasks that
contain a timestamp in one of their inputs. It will also reveal tasks that produce
non-deterministic outputs consumed by cacheable tasks downstream, for example
tasks generating code with non-deterministic method ordering or tasks producing
artifacts that include timestamps.

The experiment will assist you to first identify those tasks whose outputs are
not taken from the local build cache due to changed inputs or to ensure
correctness of the build, to then make an informed decision which of those
tasks are worth improving to make your build faster, to then investigate why
they are not taken from the local build cache, and to finally fix them once you
understand the root cause.

The experiment can be run on any developer’s machine. It logically consists of
the following steps:

  1. Enable only local build caching and use an empty local build cache
  2. Run the build with a typical task invocation including the ‘clean’ task
  3. Run the build with the same task invocation including the ‘clean’ task
  4. Determine which cacheable tasks are still executed in the second run and why
  5. Assess which of the executed, cacheable tasks are worth improving
  6. Fix identified tasks

The script you have invoked automates the execution of step 1, step 2, and step 3
without modifying the project. Build scans support your investigation in step 4
and step 5.

After improving the build to make it better leverage the local build cache, you
can push your changes and run the experiment again. This creates a cycle of run
→ measure → improve → run.

Now that the project has been checked out, the first build can be run with the
given Gradle tasks. The build will be invoked with the ‘clean’ task included and
local build caching enabled. An empty local build cache will be used.

${HEADER_COLOR}Run second build${RESTORE}

Now that the first build has finished successfully, the second build can be run
with the same Gradle tasks. The build will again be invoked with the ‘clean’
task included and local build caching enabled. The local build cache populated
during the first build will be used.

Now that the second build has finished successfully, you are ready to measure in
Gradle Enterprise how well your build leverages Gradle’s local build caching
functionality for the invoked set of Gradle tasks.

The ‘Summary’ section below captures the configuration of the experiment and the
two build scans that were published as part of running the experiment. The build
scan of the second build is particularly interesting since this is where you can
inspect what tasks were not leveraging the local build cache.

The ‘Investigation Quick Links’ section below allows quick navigation to the
most relevant views in build scans to investigate what tasks were avoided due to
local build caching and what tasks executed in the second build, which of those
tasks had the biggest impact on build performance, and what caused those tasks
to not be taken from the local build cache.

The ‘Command Line Invocation’ section below demonstrates how you can rerun the
experiment with the same configuration and in non-interactive mode.

$(print_summary)

$(print_command_to_repeat_experiment)

Once you have addressed the issues surfaced in build scans and pushed the
changes to your Git repository, you can rerun the experiment and start over the
cycle of run → measure → improve → run.
