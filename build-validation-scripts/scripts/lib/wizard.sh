The experiment will run using a fresh checkout of a given project stored in
Git. The fresh checkout ensures reproducibility of the experiment across
machines and users since no local changes and commits will be accidentally
included in the validation process.

Optionally, the project can be validated and optimized on an existing
branch and only merged back to the main line once all improvements are
completed.

Once the project is checked out from Git, the experiment will invoke the
project’s contained Gradle build with a given set of tasks and an optional
set of arguments. The Gradle tasks to invoke should resemble what users
typically invoke when building the project.

The build will be invoked from the project’s root directory or from a given
sub-directory.

In order to become familiar with the experiment, it is advisable to
initially choose a task that does not take too long to complete, for example
the 'assemble' task.

Once the project is checked out from Git, the experiment will invoke the

sub-directory.

In order to become familiar with the experiment, it is advisable to
initially choose a goal that does not take too long to complete, for example
the 'install' goal.
