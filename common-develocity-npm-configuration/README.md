# Common Develocity npm Configuration

This project demonstrates a common setup of npm builds that are using Develocity in production. It is intended to serve as a starting point for projects running Develocity in production, with no configuration yet extracted into components that can be reused across projects. See inline comments for things to adjust specifically to your project.

It is assuming that the Develocity agent is set up as per instructions in the [Develocity npm user manual](https://docs.gradle.com/develocity/npm-agent/#getting_set_up).
