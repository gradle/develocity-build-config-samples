### Overview

The Common Custom User Data Maven extension for Gradle Enterprise enhances published build scans
by adding a set of tags, links and custom values that have proven to be useful for many projects building with Gradle Enterprise.

You can leverage this extension for your project in one of two ways:
1. Apply the published extension directly in your `.mvn/extensions.xml` and immediately benefit from enhanced build scans
2. Copy this repository and develop a customized version of the extension to standardize Gradle Enterprise usage across multiple projects

The additional tags, links and custom values captured by this extension include:
- A tag representing the operating system
- A tag representing how the build was invoked, be that from your IDE (IDEA, Eclipse) or from the command-line
- A tag representing builds run on CI, together with a set of tags, links and custom values specific to the CI server running the build
- For Git repositories, information on the commit id, branch name, status, and whether the checkout is dirty or not

See [CustomBuildScanEnhancements.java](./src/main/java/com/gradle/CustomBuildScanEnhancements.java) for details on what data is
captured and under which conditions.

#### Version compatibility

This table details the version compatibility of the Common Custom User Data Maven extension with the Gradle Enterprise Maven extension.

| Common Custom User Data Maven extension versions | Gradle Enterprise Maven extension versions |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `1.8+`                                           | `1.11+`                                    |
| `1.7` - `1.7.3`                                  | `1.10.1+`                                  |
| `1.3` - `1.6`                                    | `1.6.5+`                                   |
| `1.0` - `1.2`                                    | `1.0+`                                     |

### Applying the published extension

The Common Custom User Data Maven extension is available in [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.gradle/common-custom-user-data-maven-extension). This extension
requires the [Gradle Enterprise Maven extension](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.gradle/gradle-enterprise-maven-extension) to also be applied in your build in order to have an effect.

In order for the Common Custom User Data Maven extension to become active, you need to register it in the `.mvn/extensions.xml` file in your root project.
The `extensions.xml` file is the same file where you have already declared the Gradle Enterprise Maven extension. See [here](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-enterprise-build-config-samples/blob/master/common-custom-user-data-maven-extension/.mvn/extensions.xml) for an example.

#### Capturing additional tag, links and values in your build scans

You can apply additional configuration beyond what is contributed by the Common Custom User Data Maven extension by default. The additional configuration happens in a specific
Groovy script. This is a good intermediate step before creating your own extension.

The Common Custom User Data Maven extension checks for a `.mvn/gradle-enterprise-custom-user-data.groovy` Groovy script in your root project. If the file exists, it evaluates
the script with the following bindings:

- `gradleEnterprise` (type: [GradleEnterpriseApi](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-extension/api/com/gradle/maven/extension/api/GradleEnterpriseApi.html)): _configure Gradle Enterprise_
- `buildScan` (type: [BuildScanApi](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-extension/api/com/gradle/maven/extension/api/scan/BuildScanApi.html)): _configure build scan publishing and enhance build scans_
- `buildCache` (type: [BuildCacheApi](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-extension/api/com/gradle/maven/extension/api/cache/BuildCacheApi.html)): _configure build cache_
- `log` (type: [`Logger`](http://www.slf4j.org/apidocs/org/slf4j/Logger.html)): _write to the build log_
- `project` (type: [`MavenProject`](https://maven.apache.org/ref/current/maven-core/apidocs/org/apache/maven/project/MavenProject.html)): _the top-level Maven project_
- `session` (type: [`MavenSession`](https://maven.apache.org/ref/current/maven-core/apidocs/org/apache/maven/execution/MavenSession.html)): _the Maven session_

See [here](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-enterprise-build-config-samples/blob/master/common-custom-user-data-maven-extension/.mvn/gradle-enterprise-custom-user-data.groovy) for an example.

### Developing a customized version of the extension

For more flexibility, we recommend creating a copy of this repository so that you may develop a customized version of the extension and publish it internally for your projects to consume.

This approach has a number of benefits:
- Tailor the build scan enhancements to exactly the set of tags, links and custom values you require
- Standardize the configuration for connecting to Gradle Enterprise and the remote build cache in your organization, removing the need for each project to specify this configuration

If your customized extension provides all required Gradle Enterprise configuration, then a consumer project will get all the benefits of Gradle Enterprise simply by applying the
extension. The project sources provide a good template to get started with your own extension.

Refer to the [Javadoc](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-extension/api/) for more details on the key types available for use.

#### Providing Gradle Enterprise configuration in your custom Maven extension

At this time, the Gradle Enterprise server URL cannot be provided programmatically, and must be specified in a `gradle-enterprise.xml` file.
To avoid adding this configuration file to every project, it can be added to the `src/main/resources` directory so that it will be packaged in the root of your custom
extension, and discovered by Gradle Enterprise when loading the extension.  This project includes a `gradle-enterprise.sample.xml` file, which should be modified with your
server URL and renamed to `gradle-enterprise.xml`.

### Changelog

Refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-enterprise-build-config-samples/blob/master/common-custom-user-data-maven-extension/CHANGELOG.md) to see detailed changes on the versions.
